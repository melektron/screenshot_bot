## WaveShare Adapter Config

Following the instructions from the docs doesn't work, they say RPi5 is not supported.
that would be about:

```bash
# to verify that appropriate kernel modules are present
find /lib/modules/$(uname -r) -type f -name '*.ko*' | grep tc358743

# add "dtoverlay=tc358743" to boot config (in [All] section)
vim /boot/config.txt # edit...

# increase contiguous memory allocator size for large physical DMA-accessible frame buffer
# add "cma=96M" to kernel command line
vim /boot/cmdline.txt # edit...

# get some scripts to configure rpi
mkdir -p ~/Documents/screenshot_bot_install
cd ~/Documents/screenshot_bot_install
wget https://files.waveshare.com/upload/8/89/TC358743-Driver.zip
unzip TC358743-Driver.zip
cd ~/TC358743-Driver
sudo sh set_edid.sh # This executes just a v4l2-ctl command



```

The following threads talk about getting such kinds of HDMI to CSI adapters to work on pi5:
- TC358743: https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=359412
- ADV7282-M: https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?p=2156480#p2156480

Both have the same problem that RPi5 using it's new RP1 chip is much more complex system which cannot simply memory map the frame buffer. In first post they talk about getting it to work, but it doesn't really work for me. Using the v4l2-ctl frame capture test command does seem to capture frames and I was able to save raw data (with the expected byte size of 3 * HRES * VRES) but couldn't use it. gstreamer didn't work at all with this error:

```

```

Important to get this far in the first place is to add both the dtoverlay and cma (even though the second is not mentioned i the posts) configuration to boot config as described in above block for supplier documentation. However adding cma=96M breaks some other things such as GUI and apparently RTC stuff as there are crash logs in dmesg.

## camsetup script

I made this script to more easily perform the setup options for Pi 5 as described in the Forum post for TC35... (still not quite working with gstreamer).

Script:

```bash
DEVPATH=$(realpath $1)
EDIDFILE=$(realpath $2)
echo $DEVPATH
echo $EDIDFILE

# get resolultion from edid file (extract last line)
RESSTR=$(edid-decode --native-resolution $EDIDFILE | tail -n 1 | xargs)
# split at x
IFS="x"
read -a RESARR <<< "$RESSTR"
# get hres and vres
HRES=${RESARR[0]}
VRES=${RESARR[1]}

echo $HRES
echo $VRES
# save dimensions to file so other scripts can use them
echo $HRES > ~/cap_hres
echo $VRES > ~/cap_vres

# set EDID on chip
v4l2-ctl -d $DEVPATH --set-edid=file=$EDIDFILE
v4l2-ctl -d $DEVPATH --set-dv-bt-timings query
# reset links
media-ctl -d /dev/media0 -r
# set formats
media-ctl -d /dev/media0 -l ''\''csi2'\'':4 -> '\''rp1-cfe-csi2_ch0'\'':0 [1]'
media-ctl -d /dev/media0 -V ''\''csi2'\'':0 [fmt:RGB888_1X24/'"$HRES"'x'"$VRES"' field:none colorspace:srgb]'
media-ctl -d /dev/media0 -V ''\''csi2'\'':4 [fmt:RGB888_1X24/'"$HRES"'x'"$VRES"' field:none colorspace:srgb]'
v4l2-ctl -v width=$HRES,height=$VRES,pixelformat=RGB3
```

Usage:

```bash
# first param: subdevice to configure
# second param: edid to load. The resolution config used is the primary resolution in the edid (or the last printed if there are multiple)
bash camsetup.bash /dev/v4l-subdev2 TC358743-Driver/1080p30edid
```

## Command Collection


```bash
sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer
```

Visualize media device tree:

```bash
sudo apt install graphviz # only once

media-ctl --print-dot > config.dot
dot -Tpng config.dot -o config.png
```


Test if frame reading works:

```bash
v4l2-ctl --stream-mmap=3 --stream-count=100 --stream-to=/dev/null # e.g. 100 Frames
```

Query current source timings (shows resolution, ...):

```bash
v4l2-ctl -d /dev/v4l-subdev2 --query-dv-timings # subdev might be different number if other stuff is connected, see above visualization
```

Various gstreamer attempts:

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src ! video/x-raw, width=1920, height=1080, framerate=30/1 ! videoconvert ! jpegenc ! rtpjpegpay ! udpsink host=192.168.1.32 port=5200

gst-launch-1.0 -v v4l2src device=/dev/video0 num-buffers=-1 ! video/x-raw, width=1920, height=1080, framerate=30/1 ! videoconvert ! jpegenc ! rtpjpegpay ! udpsink host=192.168.1.32 port=5200

```
